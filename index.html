          Hey Tara, Happy 20th! It's March 2023, and I'm only just beginning to accept the fact that my sister is probably an adult by now. 
          It's been a seriously weird few years while you've been at uni.
          The day we left you up in Durham feels so recent, it's very weird I'll be in your shoes soon.
          I will always be grateful that I have a big sister that has vast amounts of knowledge and endless wisdom to share.

        <div class="main-text">
          So whilst I'm not a font of experience, I can find some nice photos, and put them online. If you click the button, it's pretty self
          explainatory. Warning heavy wifi usage. I would recommend using your IPad or a computer, for the best viewing experience.
          Although, I would also suggest flicking through the family computer when you get home; listening to old stories and seeing some classic videos was really nice.

          Hurry up and scamper out of Durham, I've been missing my <div class="underline"><strong>OLD TWENTY YEAR OLD</strong></div> sister.
